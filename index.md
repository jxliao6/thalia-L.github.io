<p>I am a graduate student at the department of Statistics at UC Davis. I got my bachlor's degree in Statistics from Hunan University, China. And I focused on the relationship between finance and real economy in my undergraduate time, so I am interested in High Dimensional Regression. After I realized the idea of NPL, it looks like a really amazing field to dig deeper.</p>
