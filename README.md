## Welcome to Thalia's Personal Pages

My name is Thalia(Jingxian) Liao, And Welcome to my code show!

### Personal information

I am a graduate student at the department of Statistics at UC Davis. I got my bachlorâ€˜s degree in Statistics from Hunan University, China. And I focused on the relationship between finance and real economy in my undergraduate time, so I am interested in High Dimensional Regression. After I realize the idea of NPL, I figure out it's a really amazing field to dig deeper. I am familiar with R, Python, C, and SAS.
